# Bounded Search startup profiling

## Preserved failure and question

Main CI [37299323767](https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/actions/runs/37299323767/job/111728926821) tested merge `7669713a853211bb36995039d3c16569799c3e88`. Its Shadcn dark 1440×960 Search command became active at stage +1040ms, beyond the existing 1000ms deadline. The deadline started within a 718ms main-thread task; a later 215ms task also preceded activation. No captured JavaScript error or later pending request explained the failure. Those duration-only observations do not identify a function.

Independent Search run [37299323808](https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/actions/runs/37299323808/job/111728018871) tested head `eded4c526f6f6fd46c6e4f3cfd71a091d6245ffa`; the same case was ready at +894ms. It does not replace the failed merge evidence. The application, runtime, adapter and Search-test source matched across these commits; governance and root dependency/lockfile differences remained.

A second failure comes from [run 37301908661 / job 111736429219](https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/actions/runs/37301908661/job/111736429219), artifact `11341649920`. Its actual clean checkout is `9e183f7a7d69e61d17d62d92e3ccdacd00196833`, the synthetic merge of head `350e74f9010906e1a7640b55d15d864fa7cb0f66` into `eded4c526f6f6fd46c6e4f3cfd71a091d6245ffa`. GitHub confirms both `9e183f7a` and `350e74f9` have tree `a455402a6c8904fac5b322afbdfccdd169211850`; their commit identities remain distinct.

This Shadcn light 390×960 case starts its deadline at epoch 1791199107206ms, expires at 1791199108206ms, and observes active readiness at 1791199108355ms: a real +1149ms result, 149ms late. Relative to navigation, the start is +1940.2ms, definition +2900.8ms and activation +3089.3ms. Long tasks include 1650.2–1999.2ms (349ms), 1999.6–2076.6ms (77ms), and 2076.9–2869.9ms (793ms). The later snapshot has no page errors or pending requests. The original browser observation completed at +3352.2ms, so transport completion is later too, but it does not explain away the already-late observer timestamp.

The two failures have different exact checkouts, viewport/theme conditions and timelines. The diagnostic question for each is which public-source JavaScript stacks, style/layout work or GC occupy its pre-definition and post-definition intervals. They are not assigned a shared cause. There is no production optimization or claim of root cause in this change.

### Existing second-case follow-on CPU evidence

The second artifact already contains `shadcn-light-390-post-failure-startup.cpuprofile.json`, tied to clean `9e183f7a`. Inspection of that exact checkout's test shows a separate post-failure navigation: a new context keeps the viewport but does not explicitly carry the original theme; it uses `domcontentloaded` and an 8-second active-command wait instead of the original `networkidle` plus 1000ms oracle. It has no Chrome layout/GC timeline or original-deadline clock alignment. Its existing data is retained, not replaced by the new lane.

The follow-on profile lasts approximately 1596.966ms with 1,417 samples. Summing `timeDeltas` by sampled function yields these limited leads:

- `withNativeContentLease`: about 110.8ms self-sampled time and 293.7ms inclusive time for the `SocialIcons.astro initialize → initSiteNativeControls → withNativeContentLease` stack.
- `syncOwnedSurfaceStyles`: about 59.0ms aggregate self-sampled time. The largest branch runs through `site-native-controls` and native-link fact publication; another comes from its asynchronous `setProps` path.
- `(garbage collector)`: about 85.0ms sampled time.
- `(idle)` and `(program)` account for about 398.8ms and 310.8ms respectively. `(program)` must not be labelled layout without timeline evidence.

These are sampled costs in the follow-on navigation, not exact execution accounting, not the call stack of the original 793ms task, not evidence of a dark-1440 cause, and not performance acceptance. They motivate collecting properly labelled CPU plus timeline evidence rather than discarding data already available.

## Reusable lane and provenance

`.github/workflows/search-startup-profile.yml` has a manual entry for the two explicitly bound failure scenes. For the current repair it also runs automatically on same-repository PR #777 when the profile workflow/probe paths change. Each scene fixes its own original failing application merge SHA (`7669713a…` for dark-1440, `9e183f7a…` for light-390) and uses the exact PR head as probe SHA. Unsupported scene IDs and mismatched scene/application SHAs fail closed. This is separate from required CI and has only `contents: read`; it does not rerun or overwrite the old failed job.

Four independent hosted Ubuntu 24.04 jobs cover the two scenes × `unprofiled`/`profiled`, with at most two jobs running concurrently. Every job makes exactly one browser visit. All use Node 24, the application's frozen pnpm 10.32.1 dependencies, and its existing Chromium harness. No account, remote page, production deployment or local-browser fallback is used. Application page HTTP and WebSocket requests must stay on the exact local test origin; service workers are blocked. Attempted non-local requests are aborted and make the diagnostic fail.

The candidate-owned runner stays in the `probe` checkout. It imports the existing readiness observer, 1000ms oracle and browser harness from the separate untouched `app` checkout through that application's locked tsx loader. It does not copy a dirty probe into the original source tree. `boundary.json` records both actual clean SHAs, the relevant app-file SHA-256 digests and the probe-file SHA-256 digest. Source cleanliness is checked again after server warmup and teardown. Unexpected source changes fail closed.

The warmup route list is parsed as an inert string-array literal from the original application's `scripts/test/run-runtime-tests.mjs`; the original runner is not executed. The original main-CI route warmup is therefore retained, while each measurement gets its own server, browser and fresh context. The dark-1440 failure followed earlier Search light/narrow matrix visits, whereas light-390 was the first Search case; earlier matrix visits and other shared-shard scheduling are not replayed. Network interception, phase observers, service-worker blocking, different hosted machines and CPU sampling are disclosed measurement differences. A single pair cannot isolate profiler overhead or prove a timing improvement.

## Readiness and capture boundaries

- Shared route `/zh-cn/ui-libraries/shadcn/button/`; only the two bound scenes: dark 1440×960 on `7669713a…`, light 390×960 on `9e183f7a…`. Each carries its own source, viewport, theme, original run/job/artifact and failure timing. These dimensions are not cross-combined.
- As in the current test, the deadline starts immediately after navigation's `networkidle` and successful response check. Probe, file-write and IPC time remain inside the original runner-started 1000ms deadline. There is no extra ready wait before it, widening, alternate selector, skip or retry.
- The application checkout's `readSearchReadyWithinBudget` and `searchReadinessWasOnTime` decide the result. Active-generation readiness still excludes staging/inert commands through that existing observer/oracle.
- Boundary and progress records are written before startup/navigation; the initial result is persisted before post-deadline observation, profile flushing or cleanup. The optional 10-second late observation cannot change the original result. A deadline miss keeps a failed process/job even if Search becomes ready later.
- CPU profiling uses CDP `Profiler` at a 1000µs sampling interval. Timeline categories retain task, JavaScript, style/layout, paint and V8/GC timing. Read this as sampled attribution, not exact CPU accounting.
- Init-script marks identify observer delivery of custom-element definition, three owner mounts, each materialized command and atomic three-host activation. They do not claim internal `loadPrototypes`, `renderDemo` or `nextPaint` entry/exit instrumentation. The sampled stacks provide function attribution where samples exist; unobserved work remains unknown.
- The `pui-search:probe-installed` mark and subsequent marks are present in browser performance entries and the Chrome timeline, permitting relative-navigation/trace-clock alignment. CPU-profile timestamps and timeline timestamps use Chromium's monotonic microsecond clock. Runner/browser epoch timestamps remain separately labelled.

The process is bounded to five minutes, the job to ten minutes, individual browser operations to thirty seconds, server warmup to three minutes and profile flushing/cleanup to bounded waits. The timeline keeps at most 60,000 events / 24 MiB and reports truncation as incomplete evidence. Profiled readiness is never evidence of unperturbed performance acceptance. An unprofiled diagnostic pass is one observation, not a full-suite pass or proof that the original failure is fixed.

## Artifact use and privacy

Each seven-day artifact is named with scene ID, mode, workflow run and attempt; its directory is separated by scene and mode. It contains setup/boundary/progress records, the unchanged readiness verdict, a result, bounded resource/navigation/observer timing, and for the sampled job `startup.cpuprofile`, `timeline.json` and incrementally retained `timeline.ndjson`. The JSON timeline and CPU profile can be inspected in Chrome DevTools; the newline journal preserves flushed events if completion fails. Missing final files mean incomplete capture, not success.

Only the self-owned local test page and public code are captured. No screenshots, DOM snapshots, page contents, headers, cookies, WebSocket payloads or script source are collected. CPU locations, timeline data and resource URLs omit credentials, query strings and fragments; non-local URL identities are replaced. Trace arguments are allowlisted instead of dumping raw CDP payloads. A cap, blocked external request, page error or cleanup/source-validation failure remains explicit in `result.json`.

## Local validation and remaining work

The browser-free Node contract tests cover immutable source identity, dirty-source rejection, failure-first persistence, unchanged start/deadline semantics, bounded operations, serialization of observer marks, local-only routing, URL/frame sanitization, JS/layout/GC timeline preservation, and capture truncation. Local Node 24 validation passed 16/16 probe contracts, 16/16 existing Search evidence tests and 111/111 runtime CI/runner contracts. Workflow YAML, every shell step and JavaScript syntax/format checks passed. The existing Search evidence tests remain the oracle tests; production and the original browser suite are unchanged.

Hosted execution of this new lane is still required to validate its real CDP/browser path and further localize the costs. The runner imports only the original harness and evidence helper, not the original browser test; that test’s additional post-failure navigation is not executed by this lane. No local browser or socket was launched for this implementation, no old CI job was rerun, and no sampled performance conclusion has been made. Preserve any new failure alongside the original failure; do not retry until green. After reviewing the artifacts, choose a separately bounded production optimization only if attribution supports it.

## Independent-review repair SP-01: partial capture lifecycle

The first candidate's executable negative control confirmed a real cleanup defect: when `Profiler.stop` rejected, `Tracing.end` was never sent. A failed `Tracing.start` could also leave an already-started CPU sampler without the assigned cleanup function. That candidate remains a failed review baseline, not a successfully validated hosted probe.

Capture ownership now exists before any CDP startup await. CPU stop/persistence and timeline end/EOF are independent bounded operations; failure or timeout in one does not suppress the other. Startup attempts, completion, persistence, EOF, failures and truncation are written to `profile-status.json`. Main-path completion and `finally` share the same stop promise, so partial cleanup cannot replay stop commands. A syntactically complete timeline file may contain incomplete capture data; its `metadata.complete=false` and the failed result preserve that distinction. Available CPU and timeline evidence is retained even when the other channel fails.

The repair is test-only. It retains both exact application scenes, workflow scope, sampling interval, original readiness start and 1000ms oracle. The programmatic dependency seam exercises the real runner control flow with fake browser/CDP objects; the CLI still loads real source identity, files, original helpers and browser harness. These tests establish control-flow and failure-handling behavior, not browser performance or hosted compatibility.

Post-repair browser-free coverage passes 29 probe contracts. It includes CPU stop rejection/timeout, CPU persistence failure, Trace startup rejection after CPU start, missing timeline EOF, independent EOF after end rejection, combined channel failure, concurrent/repeated stop calls, and full runner success/partial-failure paths. The full fake-runner paths assert one visit, correct scene dimensions/theme, original +149ms failure retention, and context/browser/server cleanup. The unchanged Search evidence suite and runtime contracts remain separate checks. Real Chromium/CDP execution is still pending; no production optimization or larger profiling matrix is introduced.
